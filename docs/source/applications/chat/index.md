### External member

You have the possibility to invite external members to your channel. External members are members who are not in the workspace and who are added to one, or more,  specific channel\(s\). 

This feature is useful for inviting users who are not in your company. Freelancers, for example, can be added to a specific channel to collaborate on a project. They will only have access to this channel, they will not see public channels.
